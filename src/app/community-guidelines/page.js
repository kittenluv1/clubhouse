      <p>
        To ensure ClubHouse remains a safe, respectful, and helpful space for
        everyone, please follow these guidelines when posting or interacting on
        the platform:
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4 text-2xl">Be Specific and Relevant</h2>
      <p>
        Share clear, helpful insights about your experience with the club. Reviews that are too brief, vague, or off-topic may be rejected to keep feedback meaningful for all students.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4 text-2xl">Respect Others</h2>
      <p>
        Do not name or identify individuals, including club leaders or members. Discriminatory, harassing, or hateful language of any kind is strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4 text-2xl">Stay On Topic</h2>
      <p>Ensure that all content is relevant to the club or organization being reviewed. Irrelevant or repetitive posts may be removed to maintain clarity and usefulness.</p>
